Harry, 
You asked me about the Flag Day Associates. They are a trans-national hacking group dedicated to the overthrow of western capitalism. They have been implicated in several major protests, including an attempt to take over the UK National Grid, attacks on reservoir systems and interference in bank trading networks. 

It looks like the FDA carried out fairly extensive modifications to the ship. They did a good job too. We hadn’t noticed the added bulkheads until we compared the layout with the plans from Lloyd’s Register. They seem to be there to add rigidity, though there is one additional panel at the stern that doesn’t fit the pattern and we will be removing that tonight to see what it is there for. We would have done it this afternoon but decided we should conduct our own hull survey in case there is a booby trap.
