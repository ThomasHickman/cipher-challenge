Phase Three: The Nautilus system was fully tested last night with complete success. We sailed within four hundred metres of the target and monitored all radio traffic for two hours with no sign that we were being watched or were even noticed. 

We then conducted a full radar sweep of the area and found three dead spots where we could work on the ship without detection. 

As planned, we converted the two adjacent empty containers in the middle of the stack into a large workshop area and carried out a full inspection drill. Now, even if we are boarded, our work should remain undetected. 

We retrieved Seahorse from the third container and carried out stage one of the assembly.
