Dear Mark, 

Thanks for the latest report from the on-site team. It shows that the shipboard GPS system was completely scrambled so we are not going to be able to trace her movements from that. Do we have any odd traces from onshore radar that give a hint of where she might have been? 

The comment in the last message that the pirates completed the survey even though they had moved south to avoid detection should have told me that the survey was not geographic. At first I thought it might have been referring to a telecoms survey since you mentioned the long aerial, but actually the attached message is very revealing. Still not sure what the survey was for though, and how that is connected to the missing superstructure. Can you get me any pictures? 

Harry
