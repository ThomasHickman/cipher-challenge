Phase Four: The decks were cleared by two am, and the mounting plates were prepared and measured. Mounting points were assembled by four am, though owing to the approaching dawn deployment of Seabird was postponed and we embarked on stage two of Seahorse assembly. With camouflage plates installed we set to cruising in case of air or sea surveillance, following standard routes to avoid suspicion. Monitoring of airwaves gave no cause for concern, but we have raised security levels and are using a column transposition cipher for this communication with keyword Seabird. Future comms will rely on even more security. Tonight will be used for more sea trials of the nautilus system while the assembly crew rest, and the survey team carry out further mapping. We will resume the Seahorse build at dusk tomorrow.
