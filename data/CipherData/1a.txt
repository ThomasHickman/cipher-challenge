Mark, 

Thanks for bringing me in on this one, seems like a fascinating case. 

I have three questions: 
Why would the Flag Day Associates want a SHIP? 
Why would they want THIS ship? 
Why would they want this ship NOW? 

Having read the attached document I suspect that the answers are all related to the question of what exactly she and her Flag Day Associate Crew were trying to survey. 

I am guessing that you already checked out the onboard GPS system for information about her movements, but if you did find anything I would be fascinated to hear about it. In the meantime I am pretty sure that you know more about the Flag Day Associates than you have told me, so a briefing would be much appreciated. 

All the best, 

Harry
