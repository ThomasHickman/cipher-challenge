Report on the Trojan Project 

Having drugged the crew we were able to take the ship with essentially no resistance. The crew were handed to the Somali pirates at the deep water rendezvous as planned, and we began the survey. 

Just after midnight the radar showed an approaching vessel, which our database identified as a Coastguard cutter. We headed south to avoid detection with all ship lights off. We then completed the survey in the new location after dawn. 

With the listening post installed we began assembling the equipment for phase two of the operation keeping a watch for further patrols in the sky and on the water.
