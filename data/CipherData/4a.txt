Harry, 

We completed the survey and you are not going to believe what we found. Behind the false bulkhead in the stern there was a large pumping station connected to a number of sea-facing outlets. It looks like a scuttling valve system similar to the ones used on u-boats in World War two. I can’t understand why they would go to so much effort when they could have scuttled her at any time with a small quantity of plastic explosive. The team back at NSA have run some analytics on the remaining text files we extracted from the servers onboard. These ciphers are going to be pretty hard to crack. The attached report has frequency analysis matching usual English text so we can assume that the sender was a native speaker. Did you have any thoughts on what the Nautilus system might have been, or what it was for?
